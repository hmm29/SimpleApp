# Simple App Mystro

## Instructions

Your coding challenge is to create a simple React Native Android app according to the below spec. The coding challenge is due at 9AM on Thursday.

Please send me both an APK and a link to the code on Github.

You should use Redux and in general follow React/Redux best practices.
Imagine that this will be production code and code accordingly.

You should use [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) for user accounts and to store data.

You are strongly encouraged to use additional npm modules where appropriate.

Take a look at the Mystro app for a sense of the desired look and feel if needed.

#### Requirements:

* As a user, I want to be able to log in with my email and password.
* As a user, I want to be able to create an account using my email and password.
* As a user, I want to be prompted to set my preferences (see attached screens) when I first log in
* As a user, I want to be able to view my preferences after logging in after I have set them. These preferences should carry over to any device I log in to.
* As a user, I want to be able to access the preferences wizard again to change my preferences after I have set them using a "Change Preferences" button.
* As a user, I want to be able to log out using a "Log Out" button.
